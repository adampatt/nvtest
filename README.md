Initial section displays the currently available rockets and you can sort them by weight.
Further work could be done to move the button into the weight column so you can sort by clicking there instead of an outside button.

Five most recent Launches section and Location of launchpads both use the same card css.

Further work - have a table that enables the user to sort by each column by clicking on the column title.
Seperated out functions for further unit testing.
