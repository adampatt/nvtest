# NVTest

NVTest is a project created to showcase my ability to work with React, Typescript and GraphQL.

## Project requirements
The requirements for this project were to use the SpaceX api to display the rockets that were currently available and to be able to sort them by weight.

There is also a component displaying the previous five launches and one displaying data about the launchpad sites spaceX is currently operating.

All testing is completed using Jest and React Testing Library.


## To get the project installed and running


```bash
npm install
npm run start
```
